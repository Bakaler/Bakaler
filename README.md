**Hello**

Iâ€™m Alexander Burnes-Baker and am currently studying computer sciences with a focus in application development.

**About**

Prior to getting an education in software development, I worked as a Computer Numerical Control programmer and operator for a small family business in Brooklyn, New York, tackling projects of various degrees. Before that, I was a Technical Director, leading builds for theatrical sets and other artistic installations in New York.

**Goals**

With the world being an oyster, I find myself interested in either a position where I can work on complex systems by utilzing core logic, careful design, and innovative implementations, or a position in which I can help create and organize large scale databases, create software to anaylze the information, and work on maintaining such systems. Down the road, I hope to be able to stand in a leadership positions where I can work alongside peers in developing project plans, creating monthly, weekly, and daily goals, and distributing task to subordinates in an organized manner to effieciently, and effectively, meet both sensitive deadlines and develop high quality products. 

**Projects**

Scientific Calculator -- Python -- Personal Project
Utilizing Tkinter where I made a scientific calculator that is able to handle a plethora of functions, track current equations, and handle complex mathematical problems. Functions include, but aren't limited to, standared operations, log(n), sqrt, factorials, () / Order of Operations for equations, and some others.

Kuba -- Python -- Class Project
An Object Oriented back-end program that mimics the game play of Kuba, a 2-player board game where players need to capture marbles. Although there could have been simplier ways to implement this project, going in I wanted this project to focus heavily on classes, and the ways these classes worked with one another. It utilizses Linked List, Hash-Maps, and other data structures.

Discover Daily -- Python -- Personal Project
"Discover Daily" uses Spotify's API to create a unique playlist that refreshes daily over the course of 30 days with new and unique music catered to your liked songs. This project has become something larger than I anticipated and have set on the back burner, but because I am learning something new every day, I am slowly developing it. 

**Skills**

Currently, I have worked in Python, Assembly, HTML, and CSS.

Languages I plan on picking up once I have solidified a foundational understanding of these languages include SQL, Ruby, and Perl


**All important hobbies**
 
My personal life revolves around spending time with my wife, tackling art projects, and enjoying hikes, camping, and the great outdoors. Whatever you do, do not ask me how many hours I have clocked playing Sid Meier's civilization
